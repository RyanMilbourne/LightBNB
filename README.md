## Overview
LightBNB is a simplified version of the popular Airbnb platform, designed as a learning project to explore the usage of databases, particularly PostgreSQL (PSQL). The application allows users to search for listings, view reservations, create new listings, create new user accounts, and log in/out.

### Features
* Search Listings: Explore available listings based on various criteria such as city, minimum & maximum price, and ratings.

* View Reservations: Access information about your reservations, including details about the property, reservation dates, ratings, and price.

* Create New Listing: Users can add new properties to the platform, providing details such as property name, description, amenities, location, and pricing.

* Create New User: Users can register for a new account to access personalized features and maintain a history of reservations.

* Log In: Securely log in to your account to access personalized features and manage your bookings.
